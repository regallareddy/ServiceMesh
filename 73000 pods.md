## 73,0000 pods a day ##


Linux has an abstraction layer and it think in time VS Kubernetes thinks in terms of cores.

Meta data attached to a container for much CPU it can take in a given period of time and that time is 100 milli seconds.

How much 50 milliseconds is different from half a core?
Let's consider we have 4 threads/tasks running on 4 cores and the total amount of the CPU utilization is 400 ms. Now If we have more and more threads/tasks running a container would throttle.

Now we can see how the CPU cores does share the execution of threads from Kubernetes Vs Linux. Only busy shares the count and idle containers doesn't count in the performance calculation. Let's leave about the containers aside and take the pods into the consideration. There will be 1000 of pods being executed and at any given point of time the containers being idle like the sidecars, startup etc.. they wouldn't considered as part of the performance measurement.

It means taking extra cores of memory isn't directly proportional to the better performance because the containers aren't busy.

Once the tasks/threads put on a particular CPU, weightage share system identifies who gets to run next on that particular CPU. 
If the task doesn't need to be on the CPU, it doesn't need to be on the share calculation who gets to run on next.

Let's take about the utilization vs saturation of CPU. If we have 1 task running on CPU it has been perfectly optimized 100% by the CPU and now If we saturate 20 tasks to utilize 100% of CPU.
